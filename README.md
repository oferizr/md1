See "generate_data.ipynb" for the code which generates the dataset. Running the code in the jupyter notebook is optional though not strictly necessary as the generated dataset is already included in this repository (ball_collisions.npz). A live animation example can be seen in "example_dataset_animation.gif"

See "discriminator_based_prediction.ipynb" for the code which reproduces the referenced experiment. All training simulations are again optional (though recommended, by the tester) since pretrained parameters are given in this repository as well, and may be preloaded in the notebook.
